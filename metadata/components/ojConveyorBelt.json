This attribute value is null by default, meaning that the items to scroll among are direct children of the oj-conveyor-belt. In some cases, the items to scroll among are not direct children of the oj-conveyor-belt, but are instead nested in a descendant DOM element. In such cases, this attribute should be specified to point to the descendant DOM element whose direct children are the items to scroll among. For example, if the items to scroll among are buttons in a buttonset, the buttons are direct children of the DOM element representing the buttonset. The buttonset would be the direct child of the conveyorBelt. If the id of the buttonset DOM element were 'myContentElem', then content-parent would be specified as '#myContentElem'. WARNING: The selector specified for this attribute should match only a single descendant DOM element. If multiple elements are matched, then only the first one will be used. Applications should not depend on this behavior because we reserve the right to change it in the future in order to allow and use multiple matching elements.",

The listener can cancel the launch via event.preventDefault(), \nor it can customize the menu contents by editing the menu DOM directly, and then calling refresh() on the Menu.\n\nTo help determine whether it's appropriate to cancel the launch or customize the menu, the ojBeforeOpen listener can use component API's to determine which \ntable cell, chart item, etc., is the target of the context menu. See the JSDoc and demos of the individual components for details. \n\nKeep in mind that any such logic must work whether the context menu was launched via right-click, Shift-F10, Press & Hold, or component-specific touch gesture."
